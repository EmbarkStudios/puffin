Aims to provide a safe JNI (Java Native Interface) API over the
unsafe `jni_sys` crate.

This is a very general FFI abstraction for Java VMs with a lot of unsafe code
throughout the API. There are almost certainly some edge cases with its design
that could lead to unsound behaviour but it should still be considerably safer
than working with JNI directly.

A lot of the unsafe usage relates to quite-simple use of `from_raw` APIs to
construct or cast wrapper types (around JNI pointers) which are fairly
straight-forward to verify/trust in context.

Some unsafe code has good `// # Safety` documentation (this has been enforced for
newer code) but a lot of unsafe code doesn't document invariants that are
being relied on.

The design depends on non-trivial named lifetimes across many APIs to associate
Java local references with JNI stack frames.

The crate is not very actively maintained and was practically unmaintained for
over a year before the 0.20 release.

Robert Bragg who now works at Embark Studios became the maintainer of this
crate in October 2022.

In the process of working on the `jni` crate since becoming maintainer it's
worth noting that I came across multiple APIs that I found needed to be
re-worked to address safety issues, including ensuring that APIs that are not
implemented safely are correctly declared as `unsafe`.

There has been a focus on improving safety in the last two release.

The jni crate has been used in production with the Signal messaging application
for over two years:
https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal/blob/main/rust/bridge/jni/Cargo.toml

# Some Notable Open Issues
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/422 - questions soundness of linking
  multiple versions of jni crate into an application, considering the use
  of (separately scoped) thread-local-storage to track thread attachments
- https://github.com/jni-rs/jni-rs/issues/405 - discusses the ease with which
  code may expose the JVM to invalid booleans with undefined behaviour

The \"1.0.75 -> 1.0.79\" delta meets the same criteria.

This is an incremental/delta audit - we don't claim any particular `ub-risk-N`
level for the baseline or for the final version.  OTOH note that additional
uses of `unsafe` have been reviewed in https://crrev.com/c/5178771 and the
**delta**  was evaluated as `ub-risk-3` - no known unsoundness but:
* Little safety comments to explain why a particular usage of `unsafe`
  is safe and/or necessary
* Safety analysis couldn't be done locally, but required considering the
  whole crate (e.g. checking if the public `Ref.ptr` is mutated anywhere)

WARNING: This certification is a result of a **partial** audit.  The

audits is tracked in https://github.com/mozilla/cargo-vet/issues/380
Chromium does use the `any_zlib` feature(s).  Accidentally depending on
this feature in the future is prevented using the `ban_features` feature
of `gnrt` - see:
https://crrev.com/c/4723145/31/third_party/rust/chromium_crates_io/gnrt_config.toml

Security review of earlier versions of the crate can be found at
(Google-internal, sorry): go/image-crate-chromium-security-review

I grepped for `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bfs\b'`, `'\bnet\b'`, `'\bunsafe\b'`.

All `unsafe` in `flate2` is gated behind `#[cfg(feature = "any_zlib")]`:

* The code under `src/ffi/...` will not be used because the `mod c`
  declaration in `src/ffi/mod.rs` depends on the `any_zlib` config
* 7 uses of `unsafe` in `src/mem.rs` also all depend on the
  `any_zlib` config:
    - 2 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 2 in `fn set_level` (under `impl Compress`)
    - 3 in `fn set_dictionary` (under `impl Decompress`)

All hits of `'\bfs\b'` are in comments, or example code, or test code
(but not in product code).

There were no hits of `-i cipher`, `-i crypto`, `'\bnet\b'`.

* Using trivially-safe `unsafe` in test code:

    ```
    tests/test_const.rs:unsafe fn _unsafe() {}
    tests/test_const.rs:const _UNSAFE: () = unsafe { _unsafe() };
    ```

* Using `unsafe` in a string:

    ```
    src/constfn.rs:            \"unsafe\" => Qualifiers::Unsafe,
    ```

* Using `std::fs` in `build/build.rs` to write `${OUT_DIR}/version.expr`
  which is later read back via `include!` used in `src/lib.rs`.

All two functions from the public API of this crate use `unsafe` to avoid bound
checks for an array access.  Cross-module analysis shows that the offsets can
be statically proven to be within array bounds.  More details can be found in
the unsafe review CL at https://crrev.com/c/5350386.
