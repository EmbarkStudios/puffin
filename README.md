Puffin is an instrumentation profiler written in Rust where you opt-in to profile parts of your code:

``` rust
fn my_function() {
    puffin::profile_function!():
    ...
    if ... {
        puffin::profile_scope_data!("load_image", image_name):
        ...
    }
}
```

The Puffin macros write data to a thread-local data stream. When the outermost scope of a thread is closed, the data stream is sent to a global profiler collector. The scopes are pretty light-weight, costing around 100-200 nanoseconds.

You have to turn on the profiler before it captures any data with a call to `puffin::set_scopes_on(true);`. When the profiler is off the profiler scope macros only has an overhead of 1-2 ns (and some stack space);

## UI

If you want to view a nice flamegraph of your profile data, you can use the crate `puffin-imgui` in this repo. It looks like this:
