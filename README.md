## How to use

``` rust
fn my_function() {
    puffin::profile_function!();
    ...
    if ... {
        puffin::profile_scope!("load_image", image_name);
        ...
    }
}
```

The Puffin macros write data to a thread-local data stream. When the outermost scope of a thread is closed, the data stream is sent to a global profiler collector. The scopes are pretty light-weight, costing around 100-200 nanoseconds.

You have to turn on the profiler before it captures any data with a call to `puffin::set_scopes_on(true);`. When the profiler is off the profiler scope macros only has an overhead of 1-2 ns (and some stack space);

Once per frame you need to call `puffin::GlobalProfiler::lock().new_frame();`.

## UI

To view the profile data in-game you can use [`puffin_egui`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_egui).

## Remote profiling

You can use [`puffin_http`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_http) to send profile events over TCP to [`puffin_viewer`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_viewer).

## Other

Also check out the crate [`profiling`](https://crates.io/crates/profiling) which provides a unifying layer of abstraction on top of `puffin` and other profiling crates.
