## How to use

``` rust
fn my_function() {
    puffin::profile_function!();
    ...
    if ... {
        puffin::profile_scope!("load_image", image_name);
        ...
    }
}
```

The Puffin macros write data to a thread-local data stream. When the outermost scope of a thread is closed, the data stream is sent to a global profiler collector. The scopes are pretty light-weight, costing around 60 ns on an M1 MacBook Pro.

You have to turn on the profiler before it captures any data with a call to `puffin::set_scopes_on(true);`. When the profiler is off the profiler scope macros only has an overhead of 1 ns on an M1 MacBook Pro (plus some stack space).

Once per frame you need to call `puffin::GlobalProfiler::lock().new_frame();`.

## Remote profiling

You can use [`puffin_http`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_http) to send profile events over TCP to [`puffin_viewer`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_viewer). This is as easy as:

```rs
fn main() {
    let server_addr = format!("127.0.0.1:{}", puffin_http::DEFAULT_PORT);
    let _puffin_server = puffin_http::Server::new(&server_addr).unwrap();
    eprintln!("Run this to view profiling data:  puffin_viewer {server_addr}");
    puffin::set_scopes_on(true);

    ‚Ä¶

    // You also need to periodically call
    // `puffin::GlobalProfiler::lock().new_frame();`
    // to flush the profiling events.
}
```

## [egui](https://github.com/emilk/egui) integration

To view the profile data in-game you can use [`puffin_egui`](https://github.com/EmbarkStudios/puffin/tree/main/puffin_egui).

If you are using [`eframe`](https://crates.io/crates/eframe) you can look at [this example](https://github.com/emilk/egui/tree/master/examples/puffin_profiler).
